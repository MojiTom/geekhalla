import React, { Component }  from 'react';
import { NavLink } from 'react-router-dom';

// "Menu" is apparently a keyword in React, so I named the componenent Choices. - TH

// The following component is just a placeholder, but it keeps everything working until
// it's replaced by functional code. - TH

class Choices extends Component {

    render () { 
        return (
            <div>
                Choices
            </div>
        );
    }
}

export default Choices; // React has other uses for "menu," so Choices seemed logical.
